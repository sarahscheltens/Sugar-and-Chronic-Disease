<h1>Sugar and Chronic Disease</h1>
<h4>Group 6: Sarah Scheltens, Joban Bal, and Samantha Fiskar</h4>
<p>In the 1967, results from a Harvard study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine that majorly downplayed the role of sugar in heart disease. Taking previous studies and experiments on sugar and its health effects, the study claimed the research was insufficient and full of flaws in the methods taken to study sugar&#39;s effects. Instead, the results claimed that fat was the main culprit, and needed to be cut down on by the general public. Little did anyone know, these findings were funded and backed by the Industry group called <q>The Sugar Research Foundation.</q> Stanton Glantz, an American professor, stated, <q>It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion.</q></p>
<p>In <q>The Secrets of Sugar,</q> the effect of the sugar industry on science and the health complications that can arise from sugar are described in full. Much of this industry will obstruct research or participate in manipulative practices in order to keep profits up. Making serving sizes on nutrition labels complicated and using less known names for sugar (invert sugar, corn syrup, barley malt syrup) are both ways companies hide what consumers are actually eating.</p>
<p>Currently, the average person consumes 40 kilos of sugar every year, majorly increasing levels of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Fructose in food goes into the liver and causes that energy to turn to liver fat, leading to metabolic diseases. Having a high sugar intake can lead to many diseases and could have an increased risk of death at a young age. A peer reviewed found there being no positive impacts of additive dietary fructose. The long-term effects of a high sugar diet can range from diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer to depression and cognitive impairment. The study found that limiting the daily added-sugar intake to 5-10% can reduce the risks of these diseases significantly.</p>
<p>Sugar is addictive and inhibits our ability to know when we are full, leading to over-eating. Brain imaging showed that people display an emotional response when viewing images of high sugar content foods and drinks. The availability of high-sugar foods is a contributing factor of obesity, but the addictive response that is triggered in the brain is likely the most important factor. This addictive response often is seen through emotional eating, brought on by mental health disorders. In these cases, food becomes a source of comfort rather than fuel. In this process, the long-term overconsumption of sugars causes low dopamine levels and mild depression, which is then self-regulated through more emotional eating. This sets off an on-going cycle of emotional eating and ever lowering dopamine levels, significantly harming the health of the individual.</p>
<p>These companies profit off these disordered eating habits and use their power to influence the public image in normalizing this behaviour. They ought to be held accountable to lessen the sugar in their products for the benefits of people's health. This change could improve blood sugar, energy levels, and reduce inflammation and snacking. However, the greed of these companies blinds them to the harm they are causing. The President of the Sugar Research Foundation once said <q>if Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower fat diet, for the sake of their health, they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third.</q> This shows the kind of mentality fostered by the sugar industry.</p>
<h4>Carbohydrates</h4>
<p>Carbohydrates is a wide-ranging category of food. From vegetables, fruits, beans, milk, grains, to sweet and snack, carbs are in many foods. From that list, we can see that many of these foods are very healthy and important to a good diet. In general, <q>good carbs</q> are going to be the ones found in unprocessed whole foods, and the <q>bad carbs</q> are essentially the opposite of those. While a low carb diet is not bad, it is not necessary in order to have a healthy diet. In fact, lacking too many of the <q>good carbs</q> could be harmful if those nutrients are not being replaced elsewhere in a low carb diet. When considering lowering carb intake, the only main factor to worry about is those <q>bad carbs,</q> like sugar.</p>
<h4>Canada Food Guide</h4>
<p>The Canada Food Guide is a useful resource for many people and can help better the average person&#39;s diet. However, it lacks specific recommendations when it comes to sugar intake and only recommends <q>limiting</q> sugar intake. This is a vague recommendation and could be difficult for the general population to implement.</p>
